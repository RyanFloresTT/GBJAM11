### Ryan Flores
- **Responsibilities**: I handled various technical aspects of the project, including the technical design and implementation of the Room mechanic. For a more in-depth discussion about my role in this project, head over to my blog post [here](https://www.trustytea.me/blog).
  
- **Challenges**: Hands down I think the biggest challenge for me is time. Not only because of the restraint that the GameJam presented, but because I'm also working a full-time job which limits my time even further. Besides that though, on a more technical level, the biggest challenge of this project was designing and implementing the Room mechanics. By this, I mean making it so that you can choose a piece to put into the game. This piece consists of a few rooms which all have a 'Room' script that keeps track of all the things inside the Room like where the entrance & exit doors are, as well as the entrance trigger. Robby, our other awesome developer on the project, took care of implementing a way to keep track of when a room's objective was finished, so I took that and built a 2x2 square piece. I took this piece and saved it as a prefab so I could instantiate it at runtime. This instantiation would take place at the start of each level, where the player will choose multiple different spaces to fill. Getting the UI to support this idea was also quite the challenge, I am not as UI-inclined as I'd like to be, but this gives me a chance to work on it even more. Our artist came up with some icons that I'd use to display to the player which room they were about to select, giving them an idea of what to expect, and how many points that shape would give them if they cleared it.

- **What I Learned**: Working as a team is super fun! This was my first GameJam and the first time I've ever worked with other people on a project. I think we did an amazing job and I'm proud of what we've been able to make. I have learned that communication is so crucial, even more so in a time-sensitive scenario where everyone has to be on the same page at all times. Though we had some miscommunication at first, having some people behind a few pages, we quickly recuperated, made sure that we wouldn't have that same problem again, and got back to work. We all had our own roles and we were constantly talking with each other asking questions and tweaking things according to the feedback given by the other team members.
